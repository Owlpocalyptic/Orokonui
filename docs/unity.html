            <h2>Kaka Quest</h2>
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>The overarching goal of this project is to raise local interest and engagement in Orokonui Ecosanctuary's
                kaka conservation efforts, and the survival of Otago's kaka enclave in general. To this end, this Kaka Quest
                application does several things.</p>

                <h4>Interactive Story</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a short, educational narrative "game" in which players try to guide a kaka to survival. It
                    serves to highlight the threats that kaka can face when they're in proximity of human settlements,
                    and to gently inform players of how they can make their homes and backyards safer for visiting kakas.
                </p>
                <h4>Kaka Sighting Map</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a simple interactive map of Dunedin. Users can report kaka sightings to a server, which are
                    saved for a limited time. This map also displays recent kaka sightings reported by other users.

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>This app is developed in C# via Unity, and is intended for smartphone use. It is recommended that you learn 
                how to use Unity first before working on this app, even if you are familiar with C#, because the Unity API
                and GUI take some getting used to if this is your first experience with a proper C# API. The developers of Unity
            offer a number of <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorials">excellent tutorials</a> to this end: I recommend

                    <h4>Interactive Story</h4>
                    <p>Adding to this is mostly a matter of adding new Scenes. The project includes a prefab called
                        "GameInterface", which contains all the elements common to each "act" of the interactive story.
                        This is a brief rundown of each of these elements, and what information each one needs to work:</p>
                        <div class="indented">
                            <p>Background: The primary background image of the Scene. Simply apply your desired image by
                            dragging it from the Assets/Images/Background folder and dropping it in the Source Image
                            variable space located in this element's Image (Script) component.
                            </p><p>
                            TextBox: Holds a Text element that gives the basic prompt for the act. This is mainly for
                            narrative purposes and hints. This can be moved around the screen at will: its anchor is its
                            center by default.
                            </p><p class="indented">
                                TextBox > Text: Text goes in the Text (Script) component.
                            </p><p>
                            Touch Screen: This is the component that picks up non-button press contact with the phone
                            screen. Try to avoid putting it over the button in the top left of the screen.
                            </p><p class="indented">
                                Touch Screen > Show Options: This can be used to control what text shows up in the
                                textbox, based on the index number of the Option selected in the previous scene.
                            </p><p class="indented">
                                    ex. Scene A has Options 1 and 2. SAO2 was selected, so Scene B now displays
                                    the second prompt in the List&lt;string&gt; Text Prompts.
                            </p><p>
                            btnMenu: A button that, by default, takes the user back to the MainMenu scene.
                            </p><p>
                            Options: Disabled by default (it gets enabled when the player touches the Touch Screen). This 
                            object populates itself with the choices that the player is given. It does this by means of a
                            public List&lt;string&gt; property that developers can manually add options to.
                            </p><p class="indented">
                                Options > Options: The List&lt;string&gt; of options. The index of the selected string, and
                                the value given to Next Scene Index, are both passed to the next scene via the
                                MasterFile script.
                            </p><p class="indented">
                                Next Scene Index: A string defining the next Scene to switch to once one of the options
                                is selected. Note that all Scenes should be placed in Assets/Scenes, and so all Scene
                                names should follow the format "Scenes/x", where x is the name of the .unity file that
                                holds the Scene.
                            </p><p>
                            GameInterface: The GameInterface object itself holds a couple of crucial things. First, it holds
                            a reference to the ChangeScene script, which all the buttons held in Options and btnMenu both
                            rely on. Second, it holds references to different background images, following similar rules to
                            the textbox options held by the Show Options (Script) component in Touch Screen.
                            </p><p class="indented">
                                ex. Scene A has Options 1 and 2. SAO2 was selected, so Scene B now displays the
                                second background image held by this GameInterface instance.
                            <p>
                        </div>
                        <h4>KAKA SIGHTING MAP</h4>
                        <p>This map consists of two main components: a Map (stored in a modified instance of the GameInterface
                        prefab) and a Tracker. The Tracker basically handles all the calls to the Android API, then modifies
                        the Map's position based on the device's reported location.</p>
                        <div class="indented">
                            <p>Map: Doesn't have any fields to fill.</p>
                    
                            <p>Tracker: The most important thing are the two points, Boundary TL and Boundary BR. These stand
                            for Top Left and Bottom Right, respectively, and between them represent the minimum and maximum
                            values of latitude and longitude that the map can display. To acquire the appropriate values for your
                            particular map, you should use a GPS tool (such as Google Maps) to get the latitude and longitude for
                            the locations at both points on your map.</p>
