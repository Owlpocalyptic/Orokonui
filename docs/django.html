            <h2>Kākā Quest Online</h2>
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>The overarching goal of this project is to raise local interest and engagement in Orokonui Ecosanctuary's
                kākā conservation efforts, and the survival of Otago's kaka enclave in general. To this end, this web app
                contains interactive and educational stories about the lives of kākās, and resources for learning more about
                how to best avoid harming Dunedin's fledgling kākā population. </p>
        </div>

            <h3>General Notes</h3>
            <p>
                This app is written primarily in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/">Django</a>, a web framework based on Python. The HTML and Javascript are compiled
                from an HTML framework called <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/">Jinja</a>, which allows each HTML page to have some degree of programmatic control flow
                based on what goes on in the underlying Python code
                without having to involve PHP. Its CSS is compiled from <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation">SASS</a>. Once a workstation is set up, all of this stuff can be compiled by a single command:
                <code>pipenv run python manage.py runserver</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, this web app does not incorporate many of the more elaborate features of Django, such as a full database backend or even the
                more elaborate programming made available by the incorporation of Python in the stack.
            </p>

        <div class="section" id="Game">
            <h3>Kākā Game</h3>
            <p>
                This game is built entirely in Javascript, so as to avoid having to slow matters down with page loading and passing context variables
                between views and so forth. Right now, it is the main and only point of complexity in developing for this site.
            </p>
                <div class="indented">
                    <h4>The .JSON File</h4><p class="label date"><em>/kakasite/kakas/static/data/pages.json</em></p>
                    <p>This is the "bullet" to be loaded into the "chamber" of the "gun" that is the overarching Kākā Game. It provides
                        all the information about the interactive scenes in the form of a JSON object filled with keys relating to each
                        "page" depicted in the game.
                        <div class="imgwrapper">
                            <img src="img/docs1.png"></img>
                        </div>
                        <div class="indented">
                            <p><strong>"ex":</strong> Details the extension of the image file associated with this page. For example, the extension of the image shown by page 1a is ".png".
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>"choices":</strong> Gives the text to display for each button of each choice on this page. Empty if the page is a dead end.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>"prompt":</strong> Gives the text to display in the main text box above the choices.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>"choice-ids":</strong> Contains the key values used to retrieve the scene that each choice is associated with. For example, the only choice contained on page 3a will lead to page 3b.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <h4>The Index Template</h4><p class="label date"><em>/kakasite/kakas/templates/kakas/index.html</em></p>
                    <p>This HTML holds the code for the Kākā Game as internal Javascript. The core gameplay loop is as follows:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Retrieve the current page's details as a JSON object.</li>
                            <li>Clear all HTML elements on the page of any data unique to the last page.</li>
                            <li>Insert the current page's details, including which pages it will lead to next, in the HTML elements on the page.</li>
                            <li>Wait for the player to select the next page to go to.</li>
                            <li>Repeat until no more choices can be made.</li>
                        </ol>
                        The main thing to remember about this code is that it uses <a href="https://api.jquery.com/">jQuery</a> to streamline the process of DOM
                        traversal-- basically, it makes it easier to grab an element (like a div) by its ID or other distinguishing features and do things to it.
                        A good example is the process of attaching and removing "mousedown" listeners associated with different arguments for the populate() method.
                    </p>
                        <div class="imgwrapper">
                                <img src="img/docs2.png"></img>
                            </div>
                    <p>The $ sign means that jQuery is going to find the element on the page that mathes the query-- in this case, the element with the ID of
                        "choice", plus <code>i + 1</code>. Then it does a bunch of stuff to it that would be really annoying and long-winded in default Javascript
                        in a matter of lines, including attaching a "mousedown" listener that holds the crucial (to this game) method <code>populateFromJson(id)</code>
                        to each of the choice elements it finds, where <code>id</code> is one of the values stored in the current page's JSON object's <code>choice-ids</code>
                        attribute.
                    </p>
