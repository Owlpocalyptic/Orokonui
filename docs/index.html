                <p>This project was a group project conducted over sixteen weeks, to produce a web application described as a "semester tracker". Over this
                time we managed to work with our clients to come up with a more explicit set of requirements and features to try to meet, most of which we successfully implemented.
                Our final product can be viewed <a href="http://mariadb.ict.op.ac.nz/~se18s2_01/semester-tracker-dunedin-thunder-fingers/public/">here</a>.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The main technology we used for this project is a web development framework called <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, which mostly
                relies on PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript, but does require some understanding of SQL for database calls. We used this at the recommendation of
                our lecturers, who also acted as our clients.</p>
                <p>Throughout this project, my personal contributions were manifold. I wrote a decent amount of code, especially relating to the underlying
                structure of our product's core databases (putting the "tracker" in "semester tracker", if you will). Along with Michael, I took on an administrative
                role in figuring out which tickets we wanted to tackle in each development cycle, especially in the last three sprints where our discretion
                was much more important. I tried my best to help my teammates figure out their bugs, and made sure to test features
                before we pushed them to our live site. And I cast my <a href="#Design">eye for design</a> over many of our features, even
                influencing the design decisions of my teammates.</p>
                <p>Overall I'd say that this project was a success, both in terms of being able to produce a functional product, and in terms of how much we
                all learned, as individuals and as a group. We met the course's primary objective of learning how to work in the Agile framework of development, and
                even picked up a few new skills along the way.</p>
