                <h3>Project Overview</h3><p class="label professional">Professional</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>This project is a multidisciplinary team effort created as part of the "Games" department of Project 1.
                    Students working on this project will be and have been working with two students of Otago Polytechnic's Design school, for our
                    mutual client Orokonui Ecosanctuary. This client's core concern is the conservation of South Island kākā, a 
                    native species of parrot that has recently been brought back from extinction in the Otago region.
                    More specifically, their goal for this partnership is to have an educational tool that will get people
                    in Dunedin and Otago engaged in their conservation efforts, and informed about how best to help kākā regain
                    a footing in this area of the country.
                </p>
                <p> So far, we've created two main "bands" of work through which we can accomplish these goals. The first is
                    a GPS-based kākā reporting tool, through which conscientious citizens can report sightings of kākās to Orokonui
                    itself. The tool provides a reason for people with a passing interest in kākā to regularly think about kākā, and a way
                    to help Orokonui Ecosanctuary gather data about kākā behaviour as they grow increasingly less reliant on the protection
                    that the Ecosanctuary provides them. This tool is built on Unity, and may one day be used to track kākā movement
                    live via GPS tracker bands attached to them.
                </p>
                <p> The other, more complete product is a website. This is more directly educational than the mobile app, and uses
                    a narrative-based approach to teach visitors about ways that their actions can indirectly help (or harm) kākās.
                    There will also be other resources available on this site, such as links to Orokonui's own documentation on techniques
                    and best practices to help make neighbourhoods safer for kākā visitors, and the Halo Project (largely responsible for the
                    eradication of invasive predator species known to prey on native birds in Orokonui's vicinity).
                </p>
                <p> The more discerning among you may notice, as you read the earlier entries on this site, that Orokonui is not
                    mentioned at all until you get some way into the first half of this semester. This is largely because for the first few weeks of our project, Orokonui was but a whisper of a rumour
                    of a mystery, and I was working towards a VR experience for an advocate for the visually disabled. Eventually
                    our supervisor decided to split us up into three separate nominally games-related projects, and it was at this point that
                    Orokonui became my client.

                <h3>Unity: The Ignoble Beginning</h3><p class="label date">25/2/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    
                <p>In order to get comfortable with Unity as an IDE, I started an online tutorial for <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial/introduction-roll-ball?playlist=17141">"Roll A Ball"</a>, a simple
                game that demonstrated some features of Unity's native physics engine and touched on many of the ways that Unity
                can simplify the process of creating and shipping a game. Most importantly, it gave me a refresher course in the
                fundamentals of using Unity, including the prefab system and the all-important GameObject class, from which all
                game objects in Unity are descended.
                </p>

            <div class="section" id="Week2Day2">
                <h3>Finishing The Tutorial</h3><p class="label date">28/2/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    
                <p>Egads and hurrah! I have finished the tutorial, and begun to implement some novel features. One such feature
                        is severely reducing the player's mobility if they're ever in the air, to reflect how in real life being airborne
                        makes it difficult to, for example, reverse the direction of your momentum and fly back on to a ramp that you've
                        driven off. I did this by using the "tag" system and the OnCollisionExit and OnCollisionStay events native to Unity:
                        the final solution was much simpler than I expected it to be, which is great.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>      
                        I also started exporting builds of this game, both to my Windows machine and my Android phone. The text
                        on the Android builds so far has been somewhat unpredictable: I hope to find some way to preview UIs
                        as they will show up on Android devices, but this is made somewhat difficult by the range of dimensions
                        that these devices can have.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h3>New Objectives</h3><p class="label date">4/3/2019</p><p class="label design">Design</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    
                <p>I tragically forgot my phone cable today, so I spent most of this session changing the goal of the Roll A 
                Ball game completely. Instead of collecting 12 yellow cubes without any failure condition, I transformed 
                the playing field into a sort of maze that the player has to navigate in order to win. But this maze is not 
                without its hazards-- it features a bottomless pit, that will cause the player to lose if they foolishly
                roll their ball into it.</p>
                <p>The reason for this change is to make the game more believably challenging to execute with impaired
                    vision: by introducing a loss condition, the game more accurately reflects the risks that the visually
                    impaired often have to take when doing things that the sighted often consider perfectly safe. 
                </p>

                <p>I added some more polish to my newly mazeified Roll A Ball, including a better UI (including instructions
                that disappear upon keyboard input and a button to play again if the game is ended) and a way for me to easily
                toggle between "mobile mode" and "PC mode" (which require different methods to receive user input). As a
                group we also started testing out more AR-centric input schemes (rather than touch-based mobile input
                schemes), but I haven't implemented these yet.</p>

                <h3>Eyes On The Prize</h3><p class="label date">11/3/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    
                <p>Today we looked at started to add filters and other mechanisms to impair the player's vision, so as
                    to complete our primary goal of raising awareness about visual impairments. I was able to find and
                    import a <a href="https://projectwilberforce.github.io/colorblind/">library</a> for colourblindness filters with minimal complications, and then manually messed
                    with Unity's various native forms of lighting to create a (very unrealistic) "blindness" mode. I
                    implemented these in a separate "scene" (a direct clone of the original scene) with a reversed map.
                    I tried, sort of half-heartedly, to devise a programmatic method of producing this reversed map, but
                    my knowledge of Unity is not yet so advanced.</p>

                <p>Grave news: our group has changed tracks, and structure. Instead of all three of us working on the same
                        project, we have been split up into three different groups: James on the "Blindness" application,
                        Mitchell on the "Toilets", and myself on a sort of virtual tourism application destined for Orokonui
                        Ecosanctuary. In accordance with this new era, I've started to look at VR-centric control schemes for
                        my Roll A Ball: today, I tried to implement a "look and move" scheme, where the ball's movement is directed
                        entirely by the direction that the player is looking in.
                    </p><p>
                        So far, it has not gone well. The main issue I recognized was that the player was prone to getting trapped: if they walked
                        the ball into a dead end, it was basically impossible for the player to work their camera "behind" the ball and
                        push the ball back out. There were other issues with translating the camera direction (a Vector3 object,
                        representing a straight line in 3D space) into a Quaternion (a data type that the Unity docs <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/QuaternionAndEulerRotationsInUnity.html">explicitly describe</a>
                        as "not intuitively understandable") that I couldn't really iron out in these two hours, but these are
                        less existentially dire than the control design issue I identified.</p>

                <p>Today I helped Hamish prepare computers destined for donation. We had to wipe their hard drives and install a
                    Linux distribution on them. It was pretty simple, rote work, so there wasn't much to learn. We were slowed down
                    by a clerical error (Hamish initially only left us one half of the instructions for the process-- we could set up
                    the computers, but didn't really know what we were doing with the device meant to distribute the Linux to all the
                    wiped computers), but once that was rectified it was pretty smooth sailing for us.</p>

                <h3>Out Of Control</h3><p class="label date">18/3/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    <p>Today I tried to enhance my control scheme by moving the camera as the ball moves through the space. My main
                        goal was to give the player the freedom to make choices at intersections and the ability to reverse
                        their direction, but otherwise keep them from running the ball into a position where no movement is possible
                        (unless it's an "official" trap that will swiftly end the game for them).
                    </p><p>    
                        This... didn't really work. I kept on running into issues with defining areas where the camera was supposed to switch
                        directions. Initially I thought to use Unity's native tag system as a solution, the idea being that I could tag
                        stretches of floor where I wanted the camera to point North, and stretches where it should point South, and so on.
                        Unfortunately this caused lots of issues with the boundaries between stretches of floor (the camera kept rapidly flickering
                        between the two directions, and this prevented the player from making much progress), and didn't solve the key
                        issue of the player pinning themselves against walls.
                    </p><p>  
                        Then I tried a more programmatic approach, the basic idea being that the camera's direction would be moved based on
                        the direction of the ball's movement. This was a little more successful, at least as far as preventing the flickering
                        bug of the last strategy, but once again kept on pinning the player. It was also at this point that I unwittingly
                        introduced a problematic bug that only let the ball go East or South, effectively reducing the player's range of
                        movement to a single 90 degree slice.</p>

            <h3>Stuck And Ready To</h3><p class="label date">21/3/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>I gave the VR control scheme/camera control for my Roll A Ball another go today. This time, my great brainwave
                    was to combine one of my previous, unsuccessful control schemes with the Google Cardboard's single touch input: in
                    addition to moving based on the camera's direction, the ball would only be able to move while the touch input
                    was pressed down. In theory, this would allow the player to "pause" the ball and change their direction at their
                    leisure, allowing them to escape from the dead-end traps that have plagued me for the last week and making the ball
                    less suicidally responsive in the same stroke.
                </p><p>    
                    Unfortunately, things did not shake out this way. Stopping and starting the ball did not really address the pinning
                    issue: in all of my tests, I was unable to use it to avoid trapping myself before I even reached the first loss
                    condition, much less the finish line.
                </p><p>    
                    After figuring this out, I started looking at rotating the camera at the player's discretion, but couldn't
                    figure out a satisfactory way to have both this input and the input for letting the player actually move.</p>

                <p>Today I looked at creating VR environments. I followed a simple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q9wc9Y35wg">YouTube tutorial</a> to get started: it covered
                    creating a VR setting through use of Unity sphere GameObjects and a custom material with a 360 photo applied to
                    it, emulating VR controls via the Google Daydream package for Unity, and interactive controls for players to
                    interact with. I did run into an issue with the emulator responsible for "click" events in GoogleVR, but my
                    hope is that this won't carry over to an actual Daydream-enabled device.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="Week6Day2">
            <h3>Shifting Perspective</h3><p class="label date">28/3/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>I played around with a camera object in a fresh Unity scene today. My goal was to produce something
                    similar to the camera in the evolution sandbox game Spore, so that I could better understand how the Quaternion 
                    objects used by Unity work. The way this camera works is that it can be clicked and dragged around a fixed point 
                    in the centre of the screen, so that the player can view their creation from all angles (making it easier to edit).
                    It can't be dragged so that it's beneath the floor, or directly above the creation so that it looks directly down
                    on its centre.
                </p><p> 
                    My starting point for this control scheme was the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html">"Input.GetAxis()"</a> method native to Unity, which (as you might have
                    intuited) returns a 3D vector based on the mouse's current position. It can take a string as an argument, allowing
                    developers to split the vector returned into X and Y components. This seemed to be the right port of call for my
                    intentions, as I figured it could be used to somehow translate the movement of the mouse into movement of the camera
                    object.
                </p><p> 
                    The method for this translation seemed to be <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.RotateAround.html">"Transform.RotateAround()"</a> method, which takes three arguments-- the
                    vector representing the point to rotate around, the vector representing the line around which the rotation
                    should take place, and a float representing the angle of the rotation. This last float seemed like the proper
                    place to insert the float associated with the magnitude of the mouse's movement, but in
                    practice this produced some strange behaviour once I moved the mouse in a combination of directions.</p>

                <p>Today I worked more on my camera. I hit upon the idea of splitting the two axes of movement (up-down and
                    left-right) so that it would be easier to think around the problem, and managed to come up with a very solid
                    left-right click and dragging behaviour. However, my efforts from this point to "cap" movement (to prevent
                    users from dragging so far up that the camera would have to go back down again, and vice versa) didn't seem to
                    have any consistent effect: they would often prevent my first test attempt, but become useless on subsequent attempts
                    or attempts coming from different angles.</p>

            <h3>Intermission: Security Seminar</h3><p class="label date">2/4/2019</p><p class="label professional">Professional</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>Today I attended a seminar on security in an Information Technology context. The speaker, Otago's own Thomas
                    [lastname], raised a number of points with the underlying theme of "The IT industry often forgets that
                    the minimum requirement for security is <em>safety</em>". While some of the analogies he used and conclusions
                    he reached didn't seem completely watertight, overall I do think his case was strong, and definitely worth 
                    thinking about.
                </p><p>   
                    I did think that one form of harm did go unrepresented here: Thomas covered a category that I'll refer to as
                    "psychological assault", encompassing both shock videos like the livestream of the recent Christchurch shooting
                    and targeted harassment from real-life contacts (an example being an abusive ex) intended to threaten and unsettle
                    their recepients. This is of course a very important facet of the discussion at hand here, but I'm also wondering
                    about the potential for bad actors using the same systems to spread misinformation. A great deal of harmful pseudoscience
                    has sprung off the platforms provided by social media giants like Facebook and Youtube, and it's starting to have
                    repercussions offline, like the revival of various easily vaccinated-against diseases by the "anti-vax" movement.
                    One of the chief culprits seems to be these applications' machine learning algorithms: though they were created
                    to serve a relatively innocuous purpose (helping users find the content most similar to the content they like best),
                    this can produce dangerous results when that content is, itself, dangerous.
                </p><p>   
                    While this might seem like more of a philosophical or even legal problem than a strictly technical one, it is
                    a problem that has ramifications on the world of information technology-- what the lawmakers eventually decide is 
                    appropriate to create will inevitably shape what we are allowed to create, in much the same way that architects are 
                    no longer allowed to design buildings without adequate fire escape routes. It seems counterproductive to cite our 
                    own inexperience and cut ourselves out of the discussion entirely.</p>

                <p>Because my client was unable to make an appearance today, I went outside and took some pictures of the scenery in 
                    order to fuel further explorations into VR. This time, I started trying to stitch a number of ordinary 2D images
                    together into a coherent, realistic-seeming background.

                    I think these images wound up being quite poorly suited to their job. I couldn't get to a proper forest setting, so I settled for
                    a sort of nook in the sportsground across the street from OP's D Block. The pictures didn't really fit together,
                    and I didn't find any good trees to slot in over the seams. The picture of the grass underfoot doesn't really
                    attach well to the grass at the bottom of the four "wall" pictures either, creating another set of seams that I
                    have no good way of fixing. Overall, this experience was quite disappointing, but a good reminder of why it's a good
                    idea to use a 360-degree camera if I want to create a 360-degree environment to explore in VR.</p>

            <h3>The Glorious Return</h3><p class="label date">29/4/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>After a two-week mid-semester break, I hopped right back into Unity. This time, I started working on a backup
                    project after two weeks of silence from my clients-but-not-really. This project, rather than employing AR or VR,
                    is instead a more traditional mobile game in a similar vein to games produced by Dunedin's own Runaway Games. Today I
                    mostly worked on menus and navigation between scenes, which turned out to be <a href="https://answers.unity.com/questions/1369393/how-to-switch-between-scenes.html">quite simple</a>-- just a single line of
                    code in a single script. 
                </p><p>
                    The hardest part was figuring out how to wire that script up to buttons, and "save" the most
                    recently visited scene in the event that the player wants to briefly return to the main screen. I came across the idea
                    of <a href="https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/110958/what-is-the-proper-way-to-handle-data-between-scenes">using a persistent GameObject</a> to hold the latter information 
                    in my searches online, and it seems to be more effective than the alternatives presented: using PlayerPrefs (which seem to be
                <em>too</em> persistent, as they persist between entire game sessions rather than just between scenes), and saving everything
                    into an external save file (which again provides an excessive amount of persistence, and wastes valuable CPU time on retrieving
                    all this save data every time I want to change scenes).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="Week9Day2">
            <h3>The Orokonui Delegation</h3><p class="label date">2/5/2019</p><p class="label professional">Professional</p><p class="label design">Design</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>Today I was finally able to sit down with our clients from Orokonui and make some headway in understanding
                    the exact qualities of the application I'm supposed to be creating. The main technical takeaway is that the
                    application should be quite accessible: a solution that only works at Orokonui (like ones that involve Hololens or
                    similar VR technology) could be great and immersive, but it'll only work on people who are already willing to
                    go to Orokonui. After we finished with the clients, the Design folks and I talked some more about the direction
                    we wanted to take this.
                </p><p>    
                    The Orokonui people had several different, but interlinked, ideas for what our application could do. The core goal
                    was given as "engaging the local community in Kākā conservation efforts", and we were able to come up with several
                    possible implementations. The most exciting one, an app that shows in real time where tagged Kākās currently are
                    in the Dunedin area, is also the least likely one to come to fruition: our contacts at Orokonui said that the
                    earliest we can expect any headway on that technology is August, making it a less-than-ideal starting point. Another
                    possible feature in a similar vein is a version of a web app that Orokonui already has for kias, which allows users
                    to report kia sightings. This has the advantage of being actually possible for us right now, and creates a similar 
                    "my gosh the kākās are all around me" feeling to the full-on tracker.
                </p><p>   
                    Another, more education-oriented idea we had was creating a sort of interactive story, in which players must guide
                    a kākā or family of kākās to survival. The idea is that this application would be able to teach people without seeming
                    like it's preaching to them, by letting them discover for themselves what kind of things hurt kākās in the wild. It's
                    this idea that I decided to start with: it has the lowest barrier to entry for me personally, and can be implemented

                    Today I participated in the BIT's Age Concern program, and helped senior citizens figure out their technological
                    problems. We only had one customer today, a gentleman who wanted to learn how to download a new browser, and had
                    some questions about the security of online purchases and the effect that incognito mode would have on his browsing
                    experience (as he had been asked to use it in order to sort out a technical issue with making an online payment). We were able to help him out without much
                    trouble.</p>

                <p>I worked some more on the tentatively named "KAKA QUEST" today. This time, I made a decision about the open-closed
                    principle: did I want this application to be easier to add to but harder to customize, or easier to customize but
                    harder to add to? In Unity terms, did I want to add new Scene objects for each "act" of the interactive story, or
                    handle everything in a single scene that might be harder to change elements of later?
                </p><p>         
                    I chose to err on the side of customizability: the Design students are still coming up with wacky ideas for
                    design and story elements, so I'd like to be able to say yes to some of them without having to enormously redo
                    how certain things work.</p>

                <p>With the "QUEST" about as done as it can be, until my Design minions figure out more about how they want to
                    approach the narrative, I turned to the KAKA MAP idea that we had. We'd just done GPS functionality in Android,
                    so I had some idea of how I was supposed to go about this, and I soon found that Unity had its own API for dealing
                    with location too. It was mostly straightforward. My main worry at this juncture is how I can strike an
                    efficient balance between accuracy of location and economy of data usage: if the rate of GPS requests is high, the
                    device location will be more accurate, but this comes at the cost of, well, money (and battery life). I haven't yet
                    looked into ways to regulate the rate of these requests: I know how to use coroutines, but I'm wondering if there
                    is some more API-approved way to do this, like there is in the native Android API.</p>

                <p>Today was a good day. Continuing on the work of yesterday, I was able to get the map finally to display my device's 
                    current location, opening the door to Kākā sighting reporting and sharing. The endgame plan is to have this 
                    interface display the locations of actual Kākā being tracked by Orokonui itself, but that's still a theoretical 
                    prospect until other parties working with Orokonui can finish their projects for actually tracking the Kākā. For 
                    now, I'll be focusing on manually reported sightings.
                </p><p>     
                    Figuring this out was mostly a matter of managing to link my phone to Unity for debugging purposes. There seems to
                    be a bug in Unity Remote 5 that causes Unity Remote to fail to work if Unity is opened before the phone is connected
                    to the computer. While ordinarily this wouldn't be much of a problem, my computer doesn't have GPS capabilities, so
                    it was hard to test the values between passed in to the map offset. Eventually, thanks to some <a href="https://answers.unity.com/questions/1282481/unity-remote-5-for-android-does-not-work-when-pres.html">Google sleuthing</a>, I 
                    figured out how to get around the bug, and in a matter of minutes after that used trial and error to work out
                    the maths needed to convert the latitude and longitude (rendered as percentages of the difference between the map's
                    maximum and minimum values) into a Vector2 object to reposition the map object by.</p>

                <p>Today I switched to working on the Kākā website, which is intended to be an educational resource for people in a
                    position to help prevent needless Kākā deaths. I decided to build it in Django, due to the relative ease of setting
                    up a site and routes using it and the potential for expansion given by the MVC character of the framework-- for
                    instance, Django offers in-built ways to save and authenticate user data, for if we decide to implement a forum or
                    high scores at some point. There is also a wealth of information online about working with Django, including
                    the Django developers' own docs.</p>

                <p>Worked some more on the Kākā website. The big choice today was adding Sass to the stack, to make changes to my
                    CSS less agonising: I anticipate that I'll have to pull off two or three large overhauls of the site's design before
                    this project is through, and I'm sure future devs will have to do the same.</p>
                <p>I decided to use the .sass extension rather than the .scss extension for my SASS files because, frankly, .sass is 
                    just more like Python, as it is formatted using indentations rather than curly braces and semicolons. I do find it mildly
                    irritating that the compiler breaks if I forget to put a space between a colon and the value after it, but it's not
                    a major complaint.

                </p>
                <p>I used <a href="https://www.terencelucasyap.com/using-sass-django/">this</a> tutorial to get me started. Naturally,
                I ignored the parts about the boilerplate test website as I already had a suitable Django project to apply the Sass to.</p>

                    this became unfeasible when we discovered that we could not operate the 360 degree camera without a doctorate in
                    astrophysics or something. However, after walking through Orokonui Ecosanctuary for an hour, hopefully an edifying
                    experience for the design students, we eventually encountered our contact at Orokonui ("Amanda"), who we hadn't been
                    able to get in touch with for the last three weeks. Thanks to this stroke of good luck, we were able to show her
                    my fledgling (bird pun) efforts to create a two-dimensional KAKA GAME. She seemed pleased with the direction of

            <h3>Fun With JSON</h3><p class="label date">27/5/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>Thanks to some insights from our glorious supervisor Adon, I was able to produce a very scaleable interactive game
                    in Javascript for the Orokonui Kākā web app. The "trick" is that it uses a single JSON file to store all the
                    information about each scenario: the prompt, the name of the associated image file, and most importantly the IDs of
                    the scenarios each choice in the scenario leads to. 
                    
                    When I first had the idea of using a JSON object to store all of this data, I had trouble with actually extracting
                    the data from the object. Initially I had every page stored in an array of JSON objects, each with its own unique
                    ID value, but this made extracting an individual page overcomplicated: I would have had to query the whole array in
                    search of a given ID, and then return all the values associated with that array. Adon suggested the simpler approach
                    of using each page's ID as a key in an overarching JSON object, with every other aspect of the page going into the
                    value tied to that key.

                    between devices: combined, the four 360 degree videos we have now take up 24.31GB of space between them, a little

                she would've liked a way to "go back" to the last choice she made before she lost the game (to avoid unnecessary backtracking
                through earlier choices that she'd already gotten right), and that she wanted a more emphatic ending when she finally reached

                    every single object an "ex" attribute-- an attribute that tells the main script which extension to substitute into

                <p>I also made it clear which scene was a victory, though in retrospect my original solution (a hardcoded if check

                    be to add a "victory" attribute to that object in the .json file itself, then check for it in the javascript.

                <p>Following the feedback our client gave us last week, I implemented a "go back" button that appears after every loss,
                which allows players to immediately undo their game-losing mistake and keep going. This makes the game less frustrating to
                play to completion, and makes it a more effective learning experience.
                </p>
                <p>In the process of implementing this feature, I came across the cause of a minor bug.
                The symptom of the bug was that as a player selected choices, "flashes" of previous choices would consistently start appearing
                before the result of the player's current choice appeared, as if the game were loading those choices first. Using my galaxy-sized brain
                and towering, Rick-and-Morty-watching intellect, I realized that this
                was exactly what was happening: each time my code loaded a new scene, it attached a "mousedown" event to each choice button via jQuery
                <em>without removing the mousedown events attached in the previous screens</em>. For the earlier choices, this didn't have much of an
                effect, as the page was able to run down the list of mousedown events very quickly, but as more and more events were added to the stack
                this phenomenon slowed down the page considerably. 
                </p>
                <p>Fortunately, once I figured it out it was relatively easy to google jQuery ways to remove
                listeners from existing input elements. I was briefly confused between "onclick" and "mousedown" events, but when I learned how to
                read my own code I soon found <a href="http://api.jquery.com/off/">this</a> handy method. Now my game calls it on each button before it
                tries to add any new mousedown listeners to them, resulting in expected behaviour.

                        Today I set up the Vive, with help from assorted Project room randoms. It was an interesting experience.
                        Though we experienced some minor setbacks, such as needing to switch PCs (the first computer we used had an
                        insufficient graphics card) and the endless torment of trying to extract the Ethernet cable from an unused
                        Project computer (which we wound up not even using-- there was a shorter, more accessible one among our
                        allotted supplies), our success was as inevitable as it was total.

                        Today we tried out some games on the Vive. The first one was a glitchy mess set in a maze inhabited by purple
rabbits, creatively named "Labyrinth" and filled with what I can only assume were instructions written entirely
in Chinese. This game had a really cool implementation of the teleport feature that I've heard many VR games use
to effect movement, complete with cool arcs leading directly to the crosshairs, but did not seem to be programmed
by someone with an adequate understanding of what walls are: attempting to teleport to a wall put the player halfway
inside the wall, allowing them to freely access the other side of the wall.
</p><p>
The other game was about Spiderman. The movement scheme for this game was more interesting: being based on
Spiderman, instead of teleporting or walking, the player pressed a button to shoot webs that tethered them to
objects in the game world, then another button to pull them towards the end of their web. While this was
interesting, it was not particularly intuitive, and the instructions for getting it to work vanished nigh
instantly and couldn't be pulled back up. Additionally, prolonged gameplay was vaguely nausea-inducing, mostly
from the swinging motion while the player was swinging from place to place.</p>

                        Today I completed a <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/9189-htc-vive-tutorial-for-unity">tutorial</a> on 
developing for VR devices. Essentially the key is to import the free SteamVR library from the Unity store, then
know what I'm doing with all the assets it contains. The key asset is the CameraRig prefab, which holds child
objects representing both controllers: it is this that serves as the gateway for the VR device's input signals
into the VR application.
</p><p>
I did run into a couple of problems while trying to follow this tutorial. First, the tutorial gave faulty
instructions at one step: it advised deleting a number of "actions" from the default action set. (An action
set is an extra layer of abstraction between the input received from the hardware, and the programming defined
in Unity, that allows things like personalized keybinds and cross-platform compatibility between different
VR devices).  One of the actions it said would be okay to delete was "pose"... but deleting this turned out
to not be okay, and totally neutered all inputs from both controllers (though not the headset). Frustratingly, 
it was hard to both pin down the problem (Googling the keywords and/or the error code returned a lot of results 
with similar symptoms) and fix it-- simply recreating the Pose action in the default action set was not sufficient,
and I ended up having to create an identical project (this time <em>not</em> deleting the Pose action) to get
the controllers working again.
</p><p>
Anyway, doing everything a second time did help make the process of applying VR to a project seem more simple and 
approachable on like a visceral level, so it wasn't that big a loss from a learning perspective.</p>

            Today I worked on the setting of the VR game: a forest, based loosely on the natural Otago environment that kākās
            as a species are evolved to survive in. Since we'll only have the one location (at least in the current scope), it 
            means I can put extra work into making the world look better.

        <p>
            I found a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PlAeyyJTF4">tutorial</a> that explained the concept of a 
            Terrain object in Unity; 
            this is a sort of pre-made "ground" object that can be randomly populated with objects designated as "trees" and 
            certain inconsequential decor (including grass and small stones) designated as "details". Right now, the trees are 
            serviceable (I might revisit
            them later to fine-tune their coloration so as to better mimic Otago's natural trees), but the grass is problematic.
            Since it's based entirely on 2D sprites, it seems that Unity has automatically applied rotation code to make all
            grass sprites in view rotate in unison to face the main camera of the scene. This isn't so bad if the viewer
            keeps their head level (parallel to the ground), but as soon as they look down (perpendicular to the ground), the
            grass ends up pressed flat against the ground, which is not how grass works in real life<sup>[

Today the two design students and I held a quorum regarding the VR situation, and tested out some more VR games. One
game in particular, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/629970/Beast_Pets/">"Beast Pets",</a> seemed to
hit a lot of the same tonal and thematic beats that we're trying to achieve with KAKA QUEST, especially with minor
things like the creatures' movement. There are some key differences, though: our main goal is to teach players
<em>not</em> to interfere with kākā, and so we'll probably make most of the interaction happen at a distance (and
have the kākā fly away if the player goes too close to them).
</p><p>
The other stuff we tried wasn't all that inspiring. "The Blue" was a nice VR animation about watching a whale
swim around under the sea, but it didn't have any interactivity or even programmed interactions between animals;
it was just a short VR movie. "Fun VR Farm" was, despite its promising name, not actually much fun: it suffered from
letting players switch between two different movement methods when one of those methods was vastly superior to the
others-- though it was interesting that they were able to detect which position the touch-pad was clicked from,
making the bindings for "move" and "switch movement option" the same goddamn button was almost as bad an idea as
<em>having</em> a switch movement option button in the first place-- if you can do teleportation, there's no reason
to even have the nauseating "slide" motion. I did give it a shot, thinking perhaps the sliding was for precise 
micro-movements to slide the player into the perfect position, but the slide was still much harder to use for this 
purpose than teleporting was.
</p><p>
On the plus side, this game did give me some ideas for how to make pathing work for the kākā; the animals in Fun VR Farm
basically path endlessly towards specific ball-shaped controls that the player can pick up and carry (which allows
them to compel the animals to follow them). I wonder if it would be possible to have other kākā temporarily hold
similar (but invisible) objects to cause their fellow kākā to follow them, under certain circumstances.

                <p>
                        Today the name of game was walling off most of the forest (which is way too big and sand-boxy for a singleplayer
experience centred entirely on learning how not to kill kākā) by limiting the teleportation to a specific region--
a clearing I created solely for the player to exist in.
</p><p>
While the teleportation implementation I was using (inherited from the tutorial I used last week) made it easy
to introduce teleportable locations in theory, there were one or two snags. First, apparently the tutorial's method 
requires "teleportable" objects to have Mesh Collider components for them to count. Though this makes sense in
retrospect (the method involves drawing a line from the controller to the point on a teleportable object it's
pointing at, and you'd need a mesh collider to detect individual points on an object's surface), it was not
immediately obvious and took some trial-and-error (mostly comparing different default GameObjects to see which
ones automatically worked with the teleport script) to work out.
</p><p>
Once I had a relatively small teleportable region, I thought it might be nice for the player to visually be able to
see their maximum range of travel while looking for valid locations to teleport to, so I added some extra lines
to the teleportation code to display a white ring (a .png file I created in Photoshop) over the boundaries of the
teleportable region whenever the player holds down the teleportation button. Though this strategy was quick and
easy to implement (the only hiccup was that I forgot to assign my ring asset to the right variable at first), it
does have the downside of being harder to scale-- if I wanted to add a new teleportable region of any size or shape
to my game, I would have to manually create a new ring for it instead of just slapping it in. Fortunately, the
scope of the game only calls for a single teleportable region, so for now I will be able to escape paying the
piper for my sins.</p>

                            Today I improved the teleportation system and interface by making the reticule for teleporting behave more
intuitively: instead of getting "stuck" at the edge of the teleportable region, the reticule now goes wherever the
player points, even if the area can't be teleported to. Now, when it passes over a region that isn't eligible for
teleportation, the reticule instead turns red-- the trick for which I learned from 
<a href="https://answers.unity.com/questions/353015/how-to-instantiate-a-prefab-and-change-its-color.html">this 
helpful answer at unity.com</a>. This was somewhat harder than it first seemed (at first I hoped that this line
would be all I needed), but easier than it seemed after that didn't work-- all
I had to do was create a custom shader, using code helpfully provided by 
<a href="https://answers.unity.com/questions/189695/add-color-property-to-unlit-alpha.html">this page</a>. It seems
that the original source for this code, the Unify Wiki, has moved domains in the years since 2011, making it hard
to find the true origin of this snippet. Either way, learning how to write shaders like this seems like it's going 
to be useful as my project incorporates ever-increasing numbers of 3D models and textures.

After I managed to implement the colour change, I did make a minor oversight by forgetting to include a line saying
"shouldTeleport = false", which resulted in a lot of unexpected behaviour when the player got close to the edge
of the ring. For some reason it became possible to put the reticule higher up than the floor if you managed to
escape the ring through bugs stemming from this mistake, which allowed the player to teleport far above the clearing.
Fortunately, now that I've closed off the player's ability to escape the ring, fixing the air-teleport bug itself
is no longer necessary (which is good, because I can't really tell what's causing it).

                            Today I started with making the forest more presentable: adding fog and walls to reduce visibility so that the edge 
of the world is no longer visible, and trying to find tree models that look better than the ones I've been using
so far. The fog and walls worked well (I looked up a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TChSVtI4GEk'>tutorial</a>
 for adding fog), but I gave up on tree models after a few attempts. I suppose I can bug the Design students
for better models if I really need them.
</p><p>
        
More disconcertingly, it transpired that the bug I mentioned last time was still relevant. You see, although
I had successfully prevented the player from escaping the ring of teleportation by teleporting, they could still
<em>walk</em> over the line and start teleporting upwards that way. Therefore, this time I was more aggressive
about fixing the bug: instead of allowing the player to change their elevation via teleportation, I've modified
the Teleport code to set the player rig's transform's new Y value to exactly the same as its old Y value. This will
need to be changed again if the scope grows to include natural elevation in terrain (since the way my code is now,
a person trying to teleport on top of a hill will just end up inside it), but for now I've eliminated the bugs
around this, so this is fine.

    This time, I worked on getting 3D objects into the world, the end goal being balls that the kākā can interact with.
    My scene already had objects in it, thanks to the tutorial I finished in the first couple of weeks, so in theory
    this was as easy as just reactivating the parent object. In practice, this was complicated slightly by my solution
    to an earlier problem-- my invisible cylinder, which I created to help me register valid teleportation attempts. 
    I'd left an unnecessary Capsule Collider attached to it, which meant any attempt to spawn an object inside the
    valid teleportation region (AKA the only playable area of my game) would instantly forcibly eject that object
    from the region. I was able to fix this problem entirely by deleting the Capsule Collider component.
</p><p>
    I also started working on bird spawning. Essentially, I want birds to spawn in a random region on the edge of the
    playable area. I ran into a couple of issues with spawning. Turning my first bird object into a prefab stripped the
    public GameObject reference to the spawn clearing from the resulting prefab, and it transpires that it's impossible
    to drag an object from the hierarchy to any reference on a prefab too. To remedy this, I had to modify my Bird
    code to set its reference to the spawn clearing automatically, if its reference is null to begin with.

Today marks the day I started working on my beautiful bird behaviour. The end goal is to have them flying around
in relatively believable paths, and interacting with the environment in ways that aren't just phasing through
everything that exists. To this end, I have begun researching finite state machines in Unity. There is a handy
set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEvdyefORBo">video tutorials on this very topic</a> that I have 
found on Youtube. So far it has been relatively easy to follow along and make the modifications that my project
needs as I go along (for example, eschewing the waypoint system used in the video for random direction selection,
which is better for birds).
</p><p>
I did have one problem with the random direction selection, which is that I wasn't waiting for my birds to
finish rotating before they selected another random direction and started trying to turn in <em>that</em>
direction too, which resulted in a vibrating effect but otherwise very little change in movement (since all
the new random directions averaged out to zero). To fix this, I added an extra clause in the direction
selection code which mandated that my birds would <em>not</em> attempt to rotate towards a new direction until it 
had finished rotating to the last new direction.

            Everything is terrible.
        </p><p>
            I have attempted to replace my bird orbs with models that more closely resemble actual birds. However, this has
            come at a confusing and vexing cost. These new models resist attempts to programmatically update their transform
            components, leaving my efforts to move them (a fundamental part of programming in the movement of birds) utterly
            fruitless.
        </p><p>
            I was able to ascertain two possible methods of resolving this problem. Option one is to stick with my previous 
            bird prefab, but switch the Mesh Filter on it from a sphere to the new model shape. This allows me to modify the
            transform components of the birds, but comes at the cost of divorcing the bird animations (such as hopping along
            the ground or flapping its wings) from the simple way that Unity's native FSM provides. If I am to use this
            method, I will need to find some way to invoke the animations programmatically.
        </p><p>
            Option two is to make the new prefab work, by figuring out what is causing the issue with the transform component
            not registering any attempts to change it. My efforts to Google the cause of this problem (and, ideally, solutions)
            have been abortive at best. I have yet to find any examples of this problem happening to anybody, and fear that I
            never will. Existence is pain. The gods, I can only assume, have forsaken me for my sins.

                Like a flappy PHOENIX, I have risen from the ashes of despair. As the two options I outlined last session have proven
absolutely hopeless, I have decided to build an entirely new Finite State Machine from the ground up, and thus
forge a third option from the fires of eternal suffering.
</p><p>
This new FSM has states based explicitly on the animations of the bird model that I got from the Unity Store, and 
is somehow able to execute the few lines of code I reused from my previous FSM on top of this, despite the two
hours of torment (where those precise lines of code totally failed to do anything) I endured on Monday. In other
words, it combines the best of both worlds.
</p><p>
Now the main challenge is figuring out how to have the animated hops that the bird model can do correspond to
actual movement of the model: my current implementation has the model blink briefly back to the original position
after the hop is completed, before snapping back to the new position, which is not how kākās move in real life<sup>
[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a>]</sup>. There are a couple of built-in callback methods for Unity StateBehavior descendants 
(including the class for my Hop behaviour) that may individually be crucial pieces of the puzzle here. More research
and trial and error will be required.

                            some sage words of wisdom: he pointed out that I could just use a jumping animation to have the kākā model go
                            straight up and then straight back down, then vary its X and Z positions accordingly to have it hop in a given
                            direction. I used a sin function to make the movement more natural-- on the Y axis, it slows as it goes up until it 
                            reaches the zenith of its jump, then accelerates until it hits the ground. On the X axis, its speed is basically
                            constant. This has the advantage of making it easier for me to implement multiple quick jumps: I can just multiply
                            the coefficient of the time argument by the number of jumps I want the kākā to make within a short period of time.

                <h3>Highlight Reel</h3><p class="label date">23/09/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    
                <p>Today I made it possible to highlight my birds by clicking the trigger at them. It's an extension of the same method
                        that makes teleportation possible: when the player presses the "interact" button, the controller fires out an
                        invisible laser at the target location. If this laser finds a valid target (i.e. a kākā), it returns the target's
                        "outline" component and activates it. When the interact button is released, the kākā's outline is deactivated.
                    </p><p>        
                        There were a couple of difficulties in this process, once I found the shader package that worked best with my
                        goals. It transpires that the Bird prefabs as they currently exist can't have borders around them, or even shaders--
                        they're parents that contain the actual bird model. The longest-lived error I had came down to having foolishly
                        added an "outline" component to the Bird parent, in addition to the model, which blocked my code from finding the
                        actually useful outline (since it stopped at the parent's outline component first). When I removed this from my
                        Bird prefab, everything went well.
                    </p><p>  
                        Once I had the active highlighting working, it was trivially easy to move that code to the Camera object itself, so
                        that the invisible laser is fired from between the player's eyes every frame. This way, instead of clicking a button,
                        the player simply has to look at a bird in order to highlight it. 
                    </p><p>  
                        Eventually, this feature will be enhanced by making the birds do something else while highlighted: they will speak,
                        either in regular kākā squawks or in English.                        </p>

        <p>As I am a seemingly insatiable glutton for punishment, I have returned to the cruel netherworld of quaternions and 
        rotating transforms. In this instalment, I have been trying to make the camera rotate to face the centre of my kākā 
        clearing whenever the player teleports, since the centre of the clearing (where the bird feeder will be) is the 
        primary region where gameplay will take place. So far, there seem to be issues with elevation-- though the camera
        rotates alright, for some reason at closer proximities to the centre of the map, it shows up close to the floor,
        and so ends up angled very far up.</p>

        <p>Yesterday, the design crew asked about revamping the movement scheme for the VR game. Instead of free teleportation,
                they want to experiment with allowing players to teleport to specific points: and instead of using a controller to
                do so, they want it to be based on line-of-sight, so that all a player has to do is look at an orb and then, after
                a short delay during which they can abort the teleportation, teleport to that orb.
            </p>
            <img src="img/[] - 10-17a.png"/>
            <p class="caption">The initial set of orbs.</p>
            <p>  
                I made it work. To get the delayed behaviour, as well as display a rapidly shrinking circle that acts as feedback
                for the player (so that they know they are going to teleport), I used a coroutine, which starts when the player's
                line of sight crosses a teleportation orb's collider (about 3x larger than the orbs are visually) and ends either
                when the teleportation successfully completes, or when the coroutine is aborted by the player breaking line of
                sight with the collider.
            </p>
            <img src="img/[] - 10-17b.png"/>
            <p class="caption">The teleportation coroutine.</p>
            <img src="img/[] - 10-17c.png"/>
            <p class="caption">This code is actually mostly derived from the "look to highlight" code I did in <a href="#Week10-12-2">Highlight Reel</a>.</p>
            <p> 
                This was mostly straightforward-- the few issues I ran into were silly mistakes with forgetting to assign values
                to certain variables, and at one point accidentally assigning to a captured copy of an object rather than the
                object itself. Once I got the system into a working state, I did make one key quality of life change: because
                teleporting to an orb put you within that orb's collider (since, as I mentioned earlier, the collider of an orb is
                significantly larger than the orb itself), it was somewhat difficult to get a lock on a second orb after teleporting
                once. 
            </p><p>  
                As a player is unlikely to want to teleport to the orb that they just teleported to (since they're already
                there), I solved this issue by making the teleport method a) capture the target orb's details after successfully
                teleporting to an orb, then b) deactivate that orb until the next time a teleportation is successfully triggered.
                This way, teleporting to an orb temporarily removes it from the game world, until you teleport away (restoring the
                first orb and temporarily removing the second one). This elegantly removes the collider problem, and stops the
                player from accidentally triggering mini-teleports while trying to look down.

    <h3>Model Work</h3><p class="label date">24/10/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
        
    <p>Today we started on an exciting new push to get a playable game experience in preparation for a demo at a conference
            at the town hall. This was also the first day I got to work with the new, actually kākā-adjacent model that my
            design teammates were able to procure.
        </p>
        <img src="img/[] - 10-24b.png"/>

        <img src="img/[] - 10-24a.png"/>
        <p class="caption">I also replaced the featureless white spheres with stylish Google-Maps-esque markers.</p>
    <p> 
            The model came prepackaged with a pretty decent finite state machine implementation to begin with. When I came to
            the choice between sticking with my original one or switching to the one tied to the model, I decided to switch: the 
            new finite state machine already had states for each of the kākā's animations, and usable parameters for
            transitioning between these states. However, I stuck with the original base script for my birds, only updating the
            core Update() method (which holds the logic behind state transitions) to make it work with the new finite state
            machine's parameters and states (for example, the new finite state machine has only one Hop animation, and far
            fewer "idle"-type animations).</p>

    <h3>Behaving Like Birds</h3><p class="label date">25/10/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
        
    <p>With the new model sorted, the time came to make the kākās' behaviour more believable. By just using the base
        states, I could have kākā walk and fly in straight lines, and take off and land according to whatever parameter I
        wanted: but a bunch of kākā that just proceed through a clearing in straight lines isn't very interesting, and it's
        not very realistic.
        
    </p><p> 
        The core issue here was getting the damn birds to rotate. Though I could set their rotation initially in the core
        "bird" script, allowing them to spawn at random around the central clearing and still be oriented to cross through
        it, trying to rotate them during the execution of a state proved to be completely impossible. Even calling a public
        function (local to the main script) from inside the "walk" state had no effect.
        
    </p><p> 
        After a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of trial and error and fruitless experimentation, I finally took a step so
        lateral that it solved everything: I moved the rotation code from the state's OnStateUpdate() method and put it
        in the auto-generated OnStateMove() stub which according to a default comment always executes <em>after</em>
        resolving the base Game Object's movement. In other words, the default implementation of this method was the true
        source of my previous struggles: it had been overwriting all of my attempts to rotate my birds, for some reason
        beyond my comprehension. By making it handle the rotation itself, I finally had my birds turning as they walked.
        
    </p><p> 
        This did come with the minor problem of disabling the root motion on my bird models, but I fixed that easily enough
        by adding appropriate forward movement to the OnStateMove() method too. If I ever wanted to make the birds vary
        their walking speed dynamically this could present a problem, but for now this provides the expected behaviour at
        no discernible cost.

        <h3>Getting Some Bread</h3><p class="label date">28/10/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><p class="label design">Design</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
            
        <p>Today I gave the player more ways to interact with the game. Since the core message we're trying to peddle here is
that kākās are not pests and not pets, ways of "playing" with the kākā like you might play with a cat or a dog (e.g.
throwing balls for them to play with) are problematic-- they put people in the mindset that kākās <em>are</em> pets.
Because of this, I decided to restrict direct interaction with kākā to the mostly negative. Getting close to them
causes them to fly off, and trying to lure them towards you with treats kills them-- kākā can't eat bread.
</p>
<img src="img/[] - 10-28a (kākā dead).png"/>
<p class="caption">You did this, you monster.</p><p> 
Getting the bread stuff to work without any obvious flaws was tough. Several times I ran into bugs with kākā looping
in a single state indefinitely, because my controller was trying to make them transition into the walking state from
a state that didn't already have a transition to the walking state-- the two main culprits for this were the Fly and 
Eat states. Fixing these problems was relatively easy: I just had to add the required transitions to those two
states.
</p><p> 
Another issue was kākā trying to pathfind to bread in midair-- I'd initially had kākā take a "snapshot" of all the
bread in their immediate vicinity every second, saving the location of the closest one so it could lock on to it,
but if they locked on to bread that had been in midair when they took the "snapshot" they would walk straight into
the air to the spot the bread had occupied. I solved this issue in two ways. First, the kākā now save the closest
bread object in its entirety, so that they can update their target position based on the bread's current position.
Second, to avoid kākā trying to pathfind to bread currently in a person's hand, bread no longer exists on the
"bread" layer until it is released.
</p><p> 
The other function I added was the ability to take screenshots. This was relatively easy to achieve, since Unity
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot.html">has a function to
do exactly that</a> baked into its scripting API. I added some neat features to make it more obvious that a
picture was being taken, specifically a "flash" effect (just a white quad covering the camera that briefly shows
up then vanishes) and a shutter sound effect.

        <p>I added some more sound effects to make the game more immersive. These are authentic kākā noises, sourced from the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puq1ai_gg14">first actual footage of a kākā</a> I could find on YouTube.
To get my kākā to play random sounds, I attached an array of sounds to the kākā game object and had the audio code
randomly select an index in the array to play via the gameobject's AudioSource component.
</p>

<img src="img/[] - 10-29.png"/>
<p class="caption">I also added a dying sound to the "die" method.</p><p>     
I also got around to adding a small "tutorial" in the game world. These consist of a couple of floating signs
depicting the Vive controller, which tell the player what each of the three buttons do-- one of the buttons is a
toggle for these signs, allowing the player to hide them so that they don't block out the beautiful forest
surroundings.</p>

<p>Finally, I added a tiny version of the bread model I was using directly to the kākā's right foot bone
    (the foot it lifts to its mouth when it uses its "Eat" animation). By making this piece of bread active
    when a kākā makes contact with a piece of bread and begins to "eat" it, I create the illusion that the
    kākā has picked up a chunk of the bread and is lifting it to its mouth.

        <p>I came away from the showcase last week feeling that the people I'd shown the game to were very bad at absorbing
the information in my tutorial signs. Because of this, I decided to make the tutorial much less skippable: players
now begin play in a black void, with nothing but helpful instructional signs for company. The only way to escape
this void is to actually read the signs and press the buttons on the controllers in the manner they direct. I also
took the opportunity to update the tutorial signs themselves, to make both the text more readable and to make it
more obvious which buttons are being pointed at-- they now both have stylish highlighting around the indicated
buttons, since otherwise it's easy to mistake the surface of the Vive as an entirely smooth black surface with no
buttons at all.</p>

        <h3>Quality Of Life</h3><p class="label date">07/11/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><p class="label design">Design</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
            
<p>Today was mostly focused on fixing the minor, quibbling issues that made the game feel more buggy than it needed to.
    Chief among these was fixing the behaviour of corpses: now, instead of just vanishing some time after a bird dies,
    it fades out of existence with relative grace. This was achieved through judicious application of shaders-- in life,
    each kākā uses the "Legacy/Transparent/Cutout/Bumped Diffuse" shader, and in death, they use the
    "Unlit/UnlitAlphaWithFade" shader. I made this determination because although the Unlit shader allows me to fade
    out the model's mesh render gracefully, its base state is also fairly transparent, and makes the kākā model look
    really ugly and surreal (since you can see its legs through its back, which is not normally how kākā anatomy works).
</p><p>   
    The other major issue I fixed was to do with kākā pathfinding towards bread: basically, kākā were taking too long
    to turn towards bread as they walked towards it, resulting in them tracing very large, unrealistic arcs in their
    path towards the bread. By vastly increasing their turn rate (from 0.5 to 1.75), I was able to make them turn much
    more realistically-- and this had the added bonus of letting me cut out a lot of the error-catching chaff I was
    forced to implement when I had to compensate for a long, drawn-out turns, since now the kākā are almost guaranteed
    to be turned towards their target when the time comes to consume it. This in turn made stuff like eating the bread
    much less buggy-looking.</p>

        <p>Today we showed off the kākā game a little bit for the design students' official presentation of our full project.
                We tried porting it over to their more portable Oculus initially: though it worked the day before, on the 13th,
                something went badly wrong with everything on the day of the presentation, 30 minutes before it was due to start.
                Fortunately, we were able to switch it out for the design school's Vive relatively quickly, and my own experience
                with Vives saw it running perfectly with plenty of time to spare. Once the game did open, however, I noticed that
                some of the coroutine-based features weren't working properly: the teleport circles seemed to vary quite wildly in
                speed, and as far as I could tell my spawning code for the kākā wasn't running at all-- we were stuck with just the
                initial set of three kākā.
            </p><p>  
                Overall, it was received relatively well, but wasn't the majestic showing I'd wanted it to be. Hopefully the true showcase goes better.</p>
