                <h3>Project Overview</h3><p class="label professional">Professional</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>This project is a multidisciplinary team effort created as part of the "Games" department of Project 1.
                    Students working on this project will be and have been working with two students of Otago Polytechnic's Design school, for our
                    mutual client Orokonui Ecosanctuary. This client's core concern is the conservation of South Island kākā, a 
                    native species of parrot that has recently been brought back from extinction in the Otago region.
                    More specifically, their goal for this partnership is to have an educational tool that will get people
                    in Dunedin and Otago engaged in their conservation efforts, and informed about how best to help kākā regain
                    a footing in this area of the country.
                </p>
                <p> So far, we've created two main "bands" of work through which we can accomplish these goals. The first is
                    a GPS-based kākā reporting tool, through which conscientious citizens can report sightings of kākās to Orokonui
                    itself. The tool provides a reason for people with a passing interest in kākā to regularly think about kākā, and a way
                    to help Orokonui Ecosanctuary gather data about kākā behaviour as they grow increasingly less reliant on the protection
                    that the Ecosanctuary provides them. This tool is built on Unity, and may one day be used to track kākā movement
                    live via GPS tracker bands attached to them.
                </p>
                <p> The other, more complete product is a website. This is more directly educational than the mobile app, and uses
                    a narrative-based approach to teach visitors about ways that their actions can indirectly help (or harm) kākās.
                    There will also be other resources available on this site, such as links to Orokonui's own documentation on techniques
                    and best practices to help make neighbourhoods safer for kākā visitors, and the Halo Project (largely responsible for the
                    eradication of invasive predator species known to prey on native birds in Orokonui's vicinity).
                </p>
                <p> The more discerning among you may notice, as you read the earlier entries on this site, that Orokonui is not
                    mentioned at all until you get some way into the first half of this semester. This is largely because for the first few weeks of our project, Orokonui was but a whisper of a rumour
                    of a mystery, and I was working towards a VR experience for an advocate for the visually disabled. Eventually
                    our supervisor decided to split us up into three separate nominally games-related projects, and it was at this point that
                    Orokonui became my client.

                <h3>Unity: The Ignoble Beginning</h3><p class="label date">25/2/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    
                <p>In order to get comfortable with Unity as an IDE, I started an online tutorial for "Roll A Ball", a simple
                game that demonstrated some features of Unity's native physics engine and touched on many of the ways that Unity
                can simplify the process of creating and shipping a game. Most importantly, it gave me a refresher course in the
                fundamentals of using Unity, including the prefab system and the all-important GameObject class, from which all
                game objects in Unity are descended.

                <h3>Finishing The Tutorial</h3><p class="label date">28/2/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    
                <p>Egads and hurrah! I have finished the tutorial, and begun to implement some novel features. One such feature
                        is severely reducing the player's mobility if they're ever in the air, to reflect how in real life being airborne
                        makes it difficult to, for example, reverse the direction of your momentum and fly back on to a ramp that you've
                        driven off. I did this by using the "tag" system and the OnCollisionExit and OnCollisionStay events native to Unity:
                        the final solution was much simpler than I expected it to be, which is great.

                <p>      
                        I also started exporting builds of this game, both to my Windows machine and my Android phone. The text
                        on the Android builds so far has been somewhat unpredictable: I hope to find some way to preview UIs
                        as they will show up on Android devices, but this is made somewhat difficult by the range of dimensions
                        that these devices can have.

                <p>I tragically forgot my phone cable today, so I spent most of this session changing the goal of the Roll A 
                Ball game completely. Instead of collecting 12 yellow cubes without any failure condition, I transformed 
                the playing field into a sort of maze that the player has to navigate in order to win. But this maze is not 
                without its hazards-- it features a bottomless pit, that will cause the player to lose if they foolishly
                roll their ball into it.</p>
                <p>The reason for this change is to make the game more believably challenging to execute with impaired
                    vision: by introducing a loss condition, the game more accurately reflects the risks that the visually
                    impaired often have to take when doing things that the sighted often consider perfectly safe.

                <p>I added some more polish to my newly mazeified Roll A Ball, including a better UI (including instructions
                that disappear upon keyboard input and a button to play again if the game is ended) and a way for me to easily
                toggle between "mobile mode" and "PC mode" (which require different methods to receive user input). As a
                group we also started testing out more AR-centric input schemes (rather than touch-based mobile input
                schemes), but I haven't implemented these yet.</p>

                <p>Today we looked at started to add filters and other mechanisms to impair the player's vision, so as
                    to complete our primary goal of raising awareness about visual impairments. I was able to find and
                    import a library for colourblindness filters with minimal complications, and then manually messed
                    with Unity's various native forms of lighting to create a (very unrealistic) "blindness" mode. I
                    implemented these in a separate "scene" (a direct clone of the original scene) with a reversed map.
                    I tried, sort of half-heartedly, to devise a programmatic method of producing this reversed map, but
                    my knowledge of Unity is not yet so advanced.</p>

                <h3>Brave New World</h3><p class="label date">14/3/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><p class="label design">Design</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    
                <p>Grave news: our group has changed tracks, and structure. Instead of all three of us working on the same
                        project, we have been split up into three different groups: James on the "Blindness" application,
                        Mitchell on the "Toilets", and myself on a sort of virtual tourism application destined for Orokonui
                        Ecosanctuary. In accordance with this new era, I've started to look at VR-centric control schemes for
                        my Roll A Ball: today, I tried to implement a "look and move" scheme, where the ball's movement is directed
                        entirely by the direction that the player is looking in.
                    </p><p>
                        So far, it has not gone well. The main issue I recognized was that the player was prone to getting trapped: if they walked
                        the ball into a dead end, it was basically impossible for the player to work their camera "behind" the ball and
                        push the ball back out. There were other issues with translating the camera direction (a Vector3 object,
                        representing a straight line in 3D space) into a Quaternion (a data type that the Unity docs explicitly describes
                        as "not intuitively understandable") that I couldn't really iron out in these two hours, but these are
                        less existentially dire than the control design issue I identified.</p>

                <h3>Intermission: Computer Donation</h3><p class="label date">15/3/2019</p><p class="label community">Community</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>Today I helped Hamish prepare computers destined for donation. We had to wipe their hard drives and install a
                    Linux distribution on them. It was pretty simple, rote work, so there wasn't much to learn. We were slowed down
                    by a clerical error (Hamish initially only left us one half of the instructions for the process-- we could set up
                    the computers, but didn't really know what we were doing with the device meant to distribute the Linux to all the
                    wiped computers), but once that was rectified it was pretty smooth sailing for us.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="Week5Day1">
                <h3>Out Of Control</h3><p class="label date">18/3/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                    <p>Today I tried to enhance my control scheme by moving the camera as the ball moves through the space. My main
                        goal was to give the player the freedom to make choices at intersections and the ability to reverse
                        their direction, but otherwise keep them from running the ball into a position where no movement is possible
                        (unless it's an "official" trap that will swiftly end the game for them).
                    </p><p>    
                        This... didn't really work. I kept on running into issues with defining areas where the camera was supposed to switch
                        directions. Initially I thought to use Unity's native tag system as a solution, the idea being that I could tag
                        stretches of floor where I wanted the camera to point North, and stretches where it should point South, and so on.
                        Unfortunately this caused lots of issues with the boundaries between stretches of floor (the camera kept rapidly flickering
                        between the two directions, and this prevented the player from making much progress), and didn't solve the key
                        issue of the player pinning themselves against walls.
                    </p><p>  
                        Then I tried a more programmatic approach, the basic idea being that the camera's direction would be moved based on
                        the direction of the ball's movement. This was a little more successful, at least as far as preventing the flickering
                        bug of the last strategy, but once again kept on pinning the player. It was also at this point that I unwittingly
                        introduced a problematic bug that only let the ball go East or South, effectively reducing the player's range of
                        movement to a single 90 degree slice.</p>
                </div>

            <h3>Stuck And Ready To</h3><p class="label date">21/3/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>I gave the VR control scheme/camera control for my Roll A Ball another go today. This time, my great brainwave
                    was to combine one of my previous, unsuccessful control schemes with the Google Cardboard's single touch input: in
                    addition to moving based on the camera's direction, the ball would only be able to move while the touch input
                    was pressed down. In theory, this would allow the player to "pause" the ball and change their direction at their
                    leisure, allowing them to escape from the dead-end traps that have plagued me for the last week and making the ball
                    less suicidally responsive in the same stroke.
                </p><p>    
                    Unfortunately, things did not shake out this way. Stopping and starting the ball did not really address the pinning
                    issue: in all of my tests, I was unable to use it to avoid trapping myself before I even reached the first loss
                    condition, much less the finish line.
                </p><p>    
                    After figuring this out, I started looking at rotating the camera at the player's discretion, but couldn't
                    figure out a satisfactory way to have both this input and the input for letting the player actually move.</p>

                <p>Today I looked at creating VR environments. I followed a simple YouTube tutorial to get started: it covered
                    creating a VR setting through use of Unity sphere GameObjects and a custom material with a 360 photo applied to
                    it, emulating VR controls via the Google Daydream package for Unity, and interactive controls for players to
                    interact with. I did run into an issue with the emulator responsible for "click" events in GoogleVR, but my
                    hope is that this won't carry over to an actual Daydream-enabled device.</p>

            <h3>Shifting Perspective</h3><p class="label date">28/3/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>I played around with a camera object in a fresh Unity scene today. My goal was to produce something
                    similar to the camera in the evolution sandbox game Spore, so that I could better understand how the Quaternion 
                    objects used by Unity work. The way this camera works is that it can be clicked and dragged around a fixed point 
                    in the centre of the screen, so that the player can view their creation from all angles (making it easier to edit).
                    It can't be dragged so that it's beneath the floor, or directly above the creation so that it looks directly down
                    on its centre.
                </p><p> 
                    My starting point for this control scheme was the "Input.GetAxis()" method native to Unity, which (as you might have
                    intuited) returns a 3D vector based on the mouse's current position. It can take a string as an argument, allowing
                    developers to split the vector returned into X and Y components. This seemed to be the right port of call for my
                    intentions, as I figured it could be used to somehow translate the movement of the mouse into movement of the camera
                    object.
                </p><p> 
                    The method for this translation seemed to be "Transform.RotateAround()" method, which takes three arguments-- the
                    vector representing the point to rotate around, the vector representing the line around which the rotation
                    should take place, and a float representing the angle of the rotation. This last float seemed like the proper
                    place to insert the float associated with the magnitude of the mouse's movement, but in
                    practice this produced some strange behaviour once I moved the mouse in a combination of directions.</p>

                <p>Today I worked more on my camera. I hit upon the idea of splitting the two axes of movement (up-down and
                    left-right) so that it would be easier to think around the problem, and managed to come up with a very solid
                    left-right click and dragging behaviour. However, my efforts from this point to "cap" movement (to prevent
                    users from dragging so far up that the camera would have to go back down again, and vice versa) didn't seem to
                    have any consistent effect: they would often prevent my first test attempt, but become useless on subsequent attempts
                    or attempts coming from different angles.</p>

            <h3>Intermission: Security Seminar</h3><p class="label date">2/4/2019</p><p class="label professional">Professional</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>Today I attended a seminar on security in an Information Technology context. The speaker, Otago's own Thomas
                    [lastname], raised a number of points with the underlying theme of "The IT industry often forgets that
                    the minimum requirement for security is <em>safety</em>". While some of the analogies he used and conclusions
                    he reached didn't seem completely watertight, overall I do think his case was strong, and definitely worth 
                    thinking about.
                </p><p>   
                    I did think that one form of harm did go unrepresented here: Thomas covered a category that I'll refer to as
                    "psychological assault", encompassing both shock videos like the livestream of the recent Christchurch shooting
                    and targeted harassment from real-life contacts (an example being an abusive ex) intended to threaten and unsettle
                    their recepients. This is of course a very important facet of the discussion at hand here, but I'm also wondering
                    about the potential for bad actors using the same systems to spread misinformation. A great deal of harmful pseudoscience
                    has sprung off the platforms provided by social media giants like Facebook and Youtube, and it's starting to have
                    repercussions offline, like the revival of various easily vaccinated-against diseases by the "anti-vax" movement.
                    One of the chief culprits seems to be these applications' machine learning algorithms: though they were created
                    to serve a relatively innocuous purpose (helping users find the content most similar to the content they like best),
                    this can produce dangerous results when that content is, itself, dangerous.
                </p><p>   
                    While this might seem like more of a philosophical or even legal problem than a strictly technical one, it is
                    a problem that has ramifications on the world of information technology-- what the lawmakers eventually decide is 
                    appropriate to create will inevitably shape what we are allowed to create, in much the same way that architects are 
                    no longer allowed to design buildings without adequate fire escape routes. It seems counterproductive to cite our 
                    own inexperience and cut ourselves out of the discussion entirely.</p>

                <p>Because my client was unable to make an appearance today, I went outside and took some pictures of the scenery in 
                    order to fuel further explorations into VR. This time, I started trying to stitch a number of ordinary 2D images
                    together into a coherent, realistic-seeming background.

                    I think these images wound up being quite poorly suited to their job. I couldn't get to a proper forest setting, so I settled for
                    a sort of nook in the sportsground across the street from OP's D Block. The pictures didn't really fit together,
                    and I didn't find any good trees to slot in over the seams. The picture of the grass underfoot doesn't really
                    attach well to the grass at the bottom of the four "wall" pictures either, creating another set of seams that I
                    have no good way of fixing. Overall, this experience was quite disappointing, but a good reminder of why it's a good
                    idea to use a 360-degree camera if I want to create a 360-degree environment to explore in VR.</p>

                <p>Hooray! My client(s) finally appeared in the flesh today... well, kind of. They're more like middlemen to the
                        actual client, Orokonui Ecosanctuary, which means that we still don't know exactly what product we're going to be
                        working on. What we do know is that they're both design students with Otago Polytechnic in a postgraduate course,
                        which means in theory we can make a solid team: the design students can produce assets and come up with UI schemes,
                        and I can glue it all together in Unity or whatever program we need.</p>

                <p>After a two-week mid-semester break, I hopped right back into Unity. This time, I started working on a backup
                    project after two weeks of silence from my clients-but-not-really. This project, rather than employing AR or VR,
                    is instead a more traditional mobile game in a similar vein to games produced by Dunedin's own Runaway Games. Today I
                    mostly worked on menus and navigation between scenes, which turned out to be quite simple-- just a single line of
                    code in a single script. The hardest part was figuring out how to wire that script up to buttons!</p>

                <p>Today I was finally able to sit down with our clients from Orokonui and make some headway in understanding
                    the exact qualities of the application I'm supposed to be creating. The main technical takeaway is that the
                    application should be quite accessible: a solution that only works at Orokonui (like ones that involve Hololens or
                    similar VR technology) could be great and immersive, but it'll only work on people who are already willing to
                    go to Orokonui. After we finished with the clients, the Design folks and I talked some more about the direction
                    we wanted to take this.
                </p><p>    
                    The Orokonui people had several different, but interlinked, ideas for what our application could do. The core goal
                    was given as "engaging the local community in Kaka conservation efforts", and we were able to come up with several
                    possible implementations. The most exciting one, an app that shows in real time where tagged Kakas currently are
                    in the Dunedin area, is also the least likely one to come to fruition: our contacts at Orokonui said that the
                    earliest we can expect any headway on that technology is August, making it a less-than-ideal starting point. Another
                    possible feature in a similar vein is a version of a web app that Orokonui already has for kias, which allows users
                    to report kia sightings. This has the advantage of being actually possible for us right now, and creates a similar 
                    "my gosh the kakas are all around me" feeling to the full-on tracker.
                </p><p>   
                    Another, more education-oriented idea we had was creating a sort of interactive story, in which players must guide
                    a kaka or family of kakas to survival. The idea is that this application would be able to teach people without seeming
                    like it's preaching to them, by letting them discover for themselves what kind of things hurt kakas in the wild. It's
                    this idea that I decided to start with: it has the lowest barrier to entry for me personally, and can be implemented
                    both on mobile and online.</p>

                <p>I worked some more on the tentatively named "KAKA QUEST" today. This time, I made a decision about the open-closed
                    principle: did I want this application to be easier to add to but harder to customize, or easier to customize but
                    harder to add to? In Unity terms, did I want to add new Scene objects for each "act" of the interactive story, or
                    handle everything in a single scene that might be harder to change elements of later?
                </p><p>         
                    I chose to err on the side of customizability: the Design students are still coming up with wacky ideas for
                    design and story elements, so I'd like to be able to say yes to some of them without having to enormously redo
                    how certain things work.</p>

                    approach the narrative, I turned to the KAKA MAP idea that we had. We'd just done GPS functionality in Android,
                    so I had some idea of how I was supposed to go about this, and I soon found that Unity had its own API for dealing
                    with location too. It was mostly straightforward. My main worry at this juncture is how I can strike an
                    efficient balance between accuracy of location and economy of data usage: if the rate of GPS requests is high, the
                    device location will be more accurate, but this comes at the cost of, well, money (and battery life). I haven't yet
                    looked into ways to regulate the rate of these requests: I know how to use coroutines, but I'm wondering if there
                    is some more API-approved way to do this, like there is in the native Android API.</p>

                <p>Today was a good day. Continuing on the work of yesterday, I was able to get the map finally to display my device's 
                    current location, opening the door to Kaka sighting reporting and sharing. The endgame plan is to have this 
                    interface display the locations of actual Kaka being tracked by Orokonui itself, but that's still a theoretical 
                    prospect until other parties working with Orokonui can finish their projects for actually tracking the Kaka. For 
                    now, I'll be focusing on manually reported sightings.

                    Figuring this out was mostly a matter of managing to link my phone to Unity for debugging purposes. There seems to
                    be a bug in Unity Remote 5 that causes Unity Remote to fail to work if Unity is opened before the phone is connected
                    to the computer. While ordinarily this wouldn't be much of a problem, my computer doesn't have GPS capabilities, so
                    it was hard to test the values between passed in to the map offset. Eventually, thanks to some Google sleuthing, I 
                    figured out how to get around the bug, and in a matter of minutes after that used trial and error to work out
                    the maths needed to convert the latitude and longitude (rendered as percentages of the difference between the map's
                    maximum and minimum values) into a Vector2 object to reposition the map object by.</p>

                    position to help prevent needless Kaka deaths. I decided to build it in Django, due to the relative ease of setting
                    up a site and routes using it and the potential for expansion given by the MVC character of the framework-- for
                    instance, Django offers in-built ways to save and authenticate user data, for if we decide to implement a forum or
                    high scores at some point. There is also a wealth of information online about working with Django, including

                    this project is through, and I'm sure future devs will have to do the same.</p>
                <p>I decided to use the .sass extension rather than the .scss extension for my SASS files because, frankly, .sass is 
                    just more like Python, as it is formatted using indentations rather than curly braces and semicolons. I do find it mildly

            <h3>Fun With JSON</h3><p class="label date">27/5/2019</p><p class="label technical">Technical</p><a href="#">Back to top</a>
                <p>Thanks to some insights from our glorious supervisor Adon, I was able to produce a very scaleable interactive game
                    in Javascript for the Orokonui Kaka web app. The "trick" is that it uses a single JSON file to store all the
                    information about each scenario: the prompt, the name of the associated image file, and most importantly the IDs of
                    the scenarios each choice in the scenario leads to. 
                    
                    When I first had the idea of using a JSON object to store all of this data, I had trouble with actually extracting
                    the data from the object. Initially I had every page stored in an array of JSON objects, each with its own unique
                    ID value, but this made extracting an individual page overcomplicated: I would have had to query the whole array in
                    search of a given ID, and then return all the values associated with that array. Adon suggested the simpler approach
                    of using each page's ID as a key in an overarching JSON object, with every other aspect of the page going into the
                    value tied to that key.
                </p>  
                 
                    <h4>OLD WAY</h4>
                    <code>   {
                        <div class="indented"> "pages": [
                                <div class="indented">{ "id" : "1a",
                <div class="indented">"choices": [ "Look around at the trees", "Look around at the animals" ],
                                    "prompt" : "...",
                                    "choice-ids": [ "2a", "2b" ]</div>
                            },
                            ...</div>
                        ]</div>
                    }  </code>
                    <h4>NEW WAY</h4><code>
                    {
                            <div class="indented">"pages":{
                                    <div class="indented">"1a" : {
                                            <div class="indented"> "choices": [ "Look around at the trees", "Look around at the animals" ],
                                "prompt" : "...",
                                "choice-ids": [ "2a", "2b" ]</div>
                            },
                        ...</div>
                        }</div>
                    }
                </code>
                <p>This worked a lot more cleanly, especially when it came to passing ID strings to the prototype I put in charge
                    of cutting relevant information out of the JSON file.</p>

                <p>We revisited Orokonui today, this time with a better understanding of how to operate the 360 degree camera and
                    the addition of a Zoom<sup>TM</sup> mic to our inventory. We were able to score about ten or so minutes of 360 degree
                    footage, and similar amount in high-quality audio recordings. The main hurdle here will be transporting this footage 
                    between devices: combined, the four 360 degree videos we have now take up 24.31GB of space between them, a little 
                    much to be sending through Google Drive like the photos and text files we have been trading up until now. I 
                    suggested a USB drive, though this of course is somewhat less convenient than Internet-based solutions, and for
                    now this is what we'll be going with.</p>

                <p>Today I added some minor changes to the project's .sass file to make it responsive to mobile formats. Then,
                    following some prompting from my supervisor, I looked into converting the Kaka web app into a progressive web app,
                    or a web app that can be installed directly on a computer or phone and completely or partially accessed from
                    offline, as opposed to being hosted directly on a server and therefore inaccessible without Internet access.</p>
