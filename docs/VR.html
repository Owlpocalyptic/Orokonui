            <h2>Virutal Kākā Forest</h2>
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>The overarching goal of this project is to raise local interest and engagement in Orokonui Ecosanctuary's
                kākā conservation efforts, and the survival of Otago's kākā enclave in general. To do so, this virtual reality
                game seeks to provide an engaging experience to educate and inform Dunedin locals about these
                quirky creatures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="Development">
            <h4>Development</h4>
            <p>This game is written in C# via Unity, and is intended for use on Virtual Reality devices such as the HTC Vive. Once
                again, it is recommended that developers learn how to use Unity first before working on this app, even if they are
                intimately familiar with Unity: Unity features a developed API to assist in development and make coding more
                streamlined and concise, so it can be hard to tell what's going on from a purely C# perspective. The developers of Unity
                offer a number of <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorials">excellent tutorials</a> to this end: I recommend

                <div class="indented">
                    <h4>The Core Controls</h4>
                    <p>So far, there are three main controls that the player can use. These are bound to the scene's Controller objects (more on that below).
                        Probably the most important control is Show/Hide UI: this allows the player to remove distracting UI elements, such as the game's Location
                        Markers, so they can enjoy the beautiful kākā forest without them. Next is Snapshot, which lets the player save screenshots of the VR window
                        from within the game, with just a touch of the VR controller buttons. Last is Bread: this lets the player generate a bread roll that they can
                        feed the kākā with. Note that kākā are killed by eating bread.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Birb</h4>
                    <p>The "Birb" prefab, found in the -Prefabs folder under Assets, is probably the single most crucial element of this
                        whole endeavour. It represents the titular kākā themselves, and consists of both a physical model component and
                        a logical script component. The script for Birbs is also called "Birb", but is a .cs file rather than a prefab.
                    </p>
                    <div class="indented">
                        <p>Animator: The animator component of the Birb handles the model's animations, as you might expect. However, it <em>also</em>
                        serves as the Birb's <strong>finite state machine</strong>, and details the conditions under which the Birb transitions between its states.
                        This component contains a reference to the asset named "GreyParrot", located under "Prefabs/GreyParrot/" within the Assets pane. It is this
                        that the Birb prefab actively uses as its FSM.</p>
                        <p>Birb (Script): This script is the controller for the whole Birb prefab. It consists mainly of coroutines (time-delayed methods that run
                        concurrently with each other until they're finished executing) that deal with the Birb's behaviour during the states defined by the Animator.
                        The "backbone" of these coroutines is <code>slow()</code>, which runs every 1.4 to 2.0 seconds and mostly covers the transitions between
                        states by modifying the parameters defined in the GreyParrot FSM based on programmatic stimuli.
                        </p>
                        <P>Audio Source: This component is required for the Birb prefab to play sounds. Sounds are played via the Birb script: this component is
                        exposed in the script as <code>audioSrc</code>, and the two key methods for using this are <code>audioSrc.clip = AudioClip someAudioClip</code>
                        (which sets the clip the Audio Source will be playing) and <code>audioSrc.Play()</code> (which plays the set clip once).
                        </P>
                    </div>

                    <h4>GreyParrot</h4>
                    <p>As stated before, the "GreyParrot" asset is an Animator object, and a finite state machine. It defines the states used in the Birb prefab and
                        script, and the parameters they use to transition between those states. Often, bugs relating to repeating the same action continuously are
                        because a required transition between two states was not added in this screen. To really get a handle on Unity's Animator interface, I would
                        advise watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEvdyefORBo">this series of tutorials</a> on YouTube.
                    <div class="indented">
                        <p>State Behaviour: In the root Assets folder, there are a number of .cs files with names in the format "Bird_X", where X is an action like "Eat"
                            or "Jump". These classes descend from the base class "BirbBaseFSM", and their purpose is to handle events that need to take place whenever a
                            certain state is entered. In some of these classes, notably Bird_Walk and Bird_Jump, they run code every frame in order to make the bird move
                            forward and vary their direction (this is in the <code>OnStateUpdate()</code> method, which is analogous to GameObject's <code>update()</code> method.)
                            These scripts are attached directly to the corresponding states via GreyParrot. To see this in action, just open up GreyParrot and click on one of
                            the state bubbles: states like <code>walk</code> and <code>eat</code> have such a script, while <code>fly</code> and <code>takeoff</code> lack them entirely.
                            Generating such a script for a state without one is as easy as clicking the <code>Add Behaviour</code> button in the explorer.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>[Camera Rig]</h4>
                    <p>Located in the scene itself, the camera rig is another crucial element of the project. This is the interface through which VR headsets like the
                        Oculus and HTC Vive interact with the game world. I strongly advise trying your hand at <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/9189-htc-vive-tutorial-for-unity">this tutorial</a> in a fresh project before trying to do 
                        anything that requires user interaction: understanding how the SteamVR asset package works is really important for
                        trying to add any features that need input from the VR controllers to work.</p><p>

                        Note: the tutorial above has one major mistake in it. Although it will tell you to delete the Pose option from the default Action Sets, this is
                        wrong and may break the controller's input entirely: instead, use the Pose option as the Pose Action for both of the Controllers in the [Camera Rig]. 
                        See <a href="https://forums.raywenderlich.com/t/htc-vive-tutorial-for-unity-raywenderlich-com/58993/29">here</a> for more detail.
                    </p>
                    <div class="indented">
                        <p>Controller (Left) and Controller (Right): These are, as you might expect, the virtual versions of the two controllers that all VR headsets
                            come with. SteamVR does a neat thing where it disconnects the keybindings on the controller (which will vary between difference VR devices and
                            paradigms) from the implementation of the functions that will be bound to those keys. You attach the functions to these Controller objects--
                            generally these will be identical to each other, but it is possible to make them different if you want the player to use their right hand for 
                            some tasks and their left hand for others. The tutorial linked above goes into more detail on this.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Teleport Points</h4>
                    <p>These prefabs are simple enough: drag them into the scene and put them at any point to let the player teleport to that point. There's no additional
                        overhead to this process. I will note that, as they are coded currently, birds will automatically spawn pathing towards a randomly selected teleport
                        point that exists when the game first starts.
